Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/troyrowan/local_adaptation_sequence/tree/6eedf19ce5a13f2103abc44ad365e6eb4ace4059" target="_blank">6eedf19</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>So when we run this on the log-transformed age we identify an additional 680 associated SNPs (that aren’t significant at p &lt; 1e-5 in the initial GPSM analysis)</p>
<p>Should we be conditioning on only lead variants with <code>--cojo-cond</code> instead of doing <code>--cojo-slct</code>?</p>
